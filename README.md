# CSE4/589: Modern Network Concepts - Programming Assignment 2

## Overview

This project involves the implementation of three reliable data transport protocols within a given simulator: Alternating-Bit Protocol (ABT), Go-Back-N (GBN), and Selective-Repeat (SR). The objective is to understand and apply the principles of reliable data transmission over an unreliable network.

## Objectives

1. Implement ABT, GBN, and SR protocols in the provided simulator.
2. Understand the mechanisms of reliable data transport protocols.
3. Analyze the performance of each protocol under different network conditions.

## Getting Started

### Reading Material

- **Alternating-Bit Protocol (rdt3.0):** Refer to pages 241-245 of the 8th Edition Textbook.
- **Go-Back-N Protocol:** Pages 245-250 of the textbook.
- **Selective-Repeat Protocol:** Pages 250-256 of the textbook.

## Getting Started

You have the option to complete this assignment in either C or C++. To select your language of choice, execute the following command in your terminal. This will merge the chosen language branch into the main branch of your repository.

For C:
```
cd <path_to_your_local_repo>
git fetch --all
git merge origin/c -m "lang option: c" --no-ff && git push origin main
```

For C++:
```
cd <path_to_your_local_repo>
git fetch --all
git merge origin/cpp -m "lang option: cpp" --no-ff && git push origin main
```

## Implementation Details

### Environment

- **Programming Language:** C or C++
- **Compiler:** GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Development & Testing Environment:** Ensure your code compiles and runs correctly on the assigned CSE host servers.

### Coding Guidelines

- Implement sending and receiving transport-layer code for ABT, GBN, and SR protocols.
- Ensure your code handles message and packet structures as defined in the assignment template.
- You must not involve any disk I/O unless explicitly mentioned in the assignment description.
- Do not modify any routines other than the ones you are supposed to implement.

## Software Interfaces

Your code will interact with simulated network environments. You will implement specific routines such as `A_output`, `A_input`, `A_timerinterrupt`, `A_init`, `B_input`, and `B_init`. Detailed instructions are provided in the PA2 template.

## Testing

Your implementation will be tested against various scenarios to ensure correctness and reliability under different network conditions.
